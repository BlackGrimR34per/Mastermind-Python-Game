# Mastermind-Python-Game
Implementing Mastermind with Python 

Mastermind is a game about guessing the colours that are randomly selected by the computer. The rules of the game are as below

1. The user has to guess four colours that might have been selected by the computer
2. If the user fails to guess the colours correctly, the program provides hints as to how many of the colours were correct but in the wrong place or if the colours were correct and at the right place
3. The program keeps track of the number of guesses and upon a correct guess will notify the user has won the game and display the number of guesses the user took

The game also does checking to make sure the user only makes 4 guesses and the colours guessed are part of the options provided.
